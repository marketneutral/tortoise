# tortoise.ai

A machine learning library for tabular data, based on fastai v0.7.

This is `pip -e` installable package for people who

1) loved the fastai MOOC [**Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders**](http://course18.fast.ai/ml),
2) miss the simplicity of the way `fastai` v0.70 handled structured data (`proc_df`!), and
3) want to hack on tree and random forest implementations in pure python.

The base of the package is a direct port of `structured.py` from `fastai` v0.70 as well as Jeremy's final `TreeEnsemble` code from the Random Forest from scratch lesson.
